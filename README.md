# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

The main script feed.py streams live filtered tweets that specifically contain the words birth and conviction. 
The result is to print the tweets along with their sentiment value, evaluated from naive_bayes.py.

I'm looking to add a script that will use all the streamed tweets from a week's time that have been parsed into a txt file 
to return the average sentiment for the words birth and conviction.
